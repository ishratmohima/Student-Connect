# My Classmates Webpage

##  Deployed Web Page Address:
https://ishratmohima.github.io/my_classmates

##  Project Description:
This project is a **React-based web application** which displays a list of 4 of my classmates with their names, favorite foods and favorite colors. Each classmate has an interactive **"Like"** button which permits users to express appreciation. My design follows a **modern and responsive** approach implementing **React Bootstrap** for a clean UI.

## Technologies Applied:
- **React.js** – To build the interactive UI
- **Bootstrap & React-Bootstrap** – To style and layout
- **GitHub Pages** – For deployment
- **Git & GitHub** – To control version and project management

##  Use of Generative AI:
I used **Generative AI** to assist with:
- **Code structure suggestions** – AI helped improve project organization and best practices.
- **Styling ideas** – AI provided recommendations for Bootstrap classes and CSS customization.
- **Bug fixes & debugging** – AI suggested possible fixes for minor errors.

### AI-Generated vs. My Own Work:
The core functionality, including React components, event handling and state management was **written by me**.  
 AI was used for **suggestions and optimization** mainly, not for complete code generation.  
 The final project was **manually reviewed, tested, and improved** to ensure quality.
