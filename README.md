##  Deployed Web Page Address:

##  Project Description:
I built Student Connect to refine my React skills by creating a user-friendly platform where I can add, view, and manage details about my classmates. Each classmate’s profile features their name, favorite food, and favorite color, along with options to edit or delete the profile. I also added pagination, sorting, and filtering in the table view to make the directory easy to navigate. For an extra touch, there’s a Dark Mode toggle that allows users to switch between light and dark themes.

**Key Features**
1. Add Classmates - Filling out a form with a name, favorite food, and favorite color.Validation ensures no empty or invalid inputs.
2. Edit & Delete - Existing classmate info can be updated using a simple modal form.
Profiles can be removed instantly if needed.
3. Sorting & Filtering - Sort by name, favorite food, or favorite color option is available. Filter classmates can be done with a search bar that checks all fields.
4. Pagination - How many profiles to display per page (5, 10, or 20) can be chosen.
Navigatation with Previous and Next buttons are available.
5. Dark Mode Toggle - The entire app’s theme can be instantly switched from light to dark, and vice versa.

## Technologies Applied:
- **React.js** – Handles UI components and state management.
- **Bootstrap & React-Bootstrap** – Ensures responsive design and consistent styling.
- **Data Table Library: MUI** - Its Data Grid provides robust built-in features and seamless React integration, which significantly speeds up development.
- **GitHub Pages** – Hosts the live version of the application.
- **Git & GitHub** – To control version and project management.

##  Use of Generative AI:
I used **Generative AI** to assist with:
- **Code structure suggestions** – AI helped improve project organization and best practices.
- **Styling ideas** – AI provided recommendations for Bootstrap classes and CSS customization.
- **Bug fixes & debugging** – AI suggested possible fixes for minor errors.

### AI-Generated vs. My Own Work:
The core functionality, including main functionality (form submission, editing, deleting, sorting, filtering, pagination) was **written by me**.  
 AI was used for **suggestions and optimization** mainly, not for complete code generation.  
 The final project was **manually reviewed, tested, and improved** to ensure quality.
