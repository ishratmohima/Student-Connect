# My Classmates Webpage

##  Deployed Web Page Address:
https://ishratmohima.github.io/my_classmates

##  Project Description:
This project is a **React-based web application** which displays a list of 4 of my classmates with their names, favorite foods and favorite colors. Each classmate has an interactive **"Like"** button which permits users to express appreciation. My design follows a **modern and responsive** approach implementing **React Bootstrap** for a clean UI.

## Technologies Applied:
- **React.js** – To build the interactive UI
- **Bootstrap & React-Bootstrap** – To style and layout
- **GitHub Pages** – For deployment
- **Git & GitHub** – To control version and project management

##  Use of Generative AI:
I used **Generative AI** to assist with:
- **Code structure suggestions** – AI helped improve project organization and best practices.
- **Styling ideas** – AI provided recommendations for Bootstrap classes and CSS customization.
- **Bug fixes & debugging** – AI suggested possible fixes for minor errors.

### AI-Generated vs. My Own Work:
The core functionality, including React components, event handling and state management was **written by me**.  
 AI was used for **suggestions and optimization** mainly, not for complete code generation.  
 The final project was **manually reviewed, tested, and improved** to ensure quality.

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
